        "\n
        Owl is an app that analyzes your gait with sensors in order to detect intoxication.
        If it senses that you're drunk, it'll alert a designated friend and stream your GPS location to him/her.
        \n
        We achieve this by using pedometer sensors that many fitness apps use to capture footstep data. Then,
        we  map out those footsteps over time and capture how long it takes to make each footstep.
        \n
        If the readings are consistent or gradually changing, then you are sober. If it's erratic, you're intoxicated.
